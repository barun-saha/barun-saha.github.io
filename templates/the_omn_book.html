			<strong>Opportunistic Mobile Networks: Advances and Applications</strong>
            is our forthcoming book to be published by 
            <a href="http://link.springer.com/">Springer</a>. This book,
            #TheOMNBook, if you may say, presents a thoughtful assimilation of 
            the recent advances in OMNs across
            several dimensions such as, routing, cooperation, heterogeneity,
            emotions, and more. The book also reflects on different real-life
            aspects and standards such as, Requests For Comments 
            (RFCs) and patents. A dedicated chapter on network simulation is
            aimed to help you develop and test protocols with confidence.
            Additionally, the book also focuses on a few contextual topics in
            closely related domains, wherever relevant.

            The primary objective of #TheOMNBook is to elucidate
            some of the fundamental challenges in OMNs, and guide you along
            different paths towards addressing such issues. The chapters have 
            been crafted in a way so that both beginners as well as seasoned 
            researchers would find them useful. These chapters are
            accompanied with a set of review terms and conceptual as well as
            programming exercises. Our hope herein is that #TheOMNBook would
            not only help you gain clear understanding of the fundamental 
            concepts, but also establish you on a firm ground to further extend 
            the contemporary state-of-the-art in OMNs. Opportunistic Mobile 
            Networks: Advances and Applications would be available in print as 
            well as electronic versions in 2016.
