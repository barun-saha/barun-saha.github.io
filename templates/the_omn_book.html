                    <strong>Opportunistic Mobile Networks: Advances and Applications</strong>
                    is our forthcoming book to be published by 
                    <a href="http://link.springer.com/">Springer</a>. This book,
                    #TheOMNBook, if you may say, presents a thoughtful assimilation of 
                    the recent advances in OMNs across
                    several dimensions such as, routing, cooperation, heterogeneity,
                    emotions, and more. The book also reflects on different real-life
                    aspects and standards such as, Requests For Comments 
                    (RFCs) and patents. A dedicated chapter on network simulation is
                    aimed to help you develop and test protocols with confidence.
                    Additionally, the book also focuses on a few contextual topics in
                    closely related domains, wherever relevant.

                    The primary objective of #TheOMNBook is to elucidate
                    some of the fundamental challenges in OMNs, and guide you along
                    different paths towards addressing such issues. The chapters have 
                    been crafted in a way so that both beginners as well as seasoned 
                    researchers would find them useful. These chapters are
                    accompanied with a set of review terms and conceptual as well as
                    programming exercises. Our hope herein is that #TheOMNBook would
                    not only help you gain clear understanding of the fundamental 
                    concepts, but also establish you on a firm ground to further extend 
                    the contemporary state-of-the-art in OMNs. The Foreword to
                    the book has been written by Prof.
                    <a href="http://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/mohapatra/">
