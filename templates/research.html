			My research topic is in the broad area of Delay Tolerant Networks
			(DTNs). In my MS thesis, I have attempted to explore some previously
			unaddressed issues in Pocket Switched Networks (PSNs). In particular,
			I have considered the effects of certain <em>human aspects</em>, innate
			intelligence and emotions, upon the performance of the network. As such,
			the otherwise mechanical nodes of a typical network evolve
			into <em>supernodes</em>, which are a combination of the mobile devices
			together with their human owner.
		</p>

		<p>
			I am also interested in other areas of wireless networking, for
			example, mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs).
