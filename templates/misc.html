		<h2><a href="#" name="dtn_blog">The DTN Blog</a></h2>

		<p>
		  When I started with my research back in 2011, I was quick to get familiar
		  with the Opportunistic Network Environment (ONE) simulator. However, I
		  soon realized the lack of any substantial guide and walthrough.
		  And thus, I began with the
		  <a href="http://delay-tolerant-networks.blogspot.com/">DTN blog</a>!
		</p>

		<p>
		  Although it started with Google Sites, later I switched to Blogger.
		  A blog is useful to quickly publish new contents. Moreover, comments
		  from the users provide a scope for further interaction.
		</p>

		<p>
		  As of now, the DTN blog has, among others, a three-part tutorial on
		  the ONE simulator covering various aspects &ndash; the basics,
		  parameterized simulations, and confidence intervals. However, more than
		  having a blog, I feel that through this blog I have been able to give
		  back to the research community, which itself has helped me on different
		  queries on a more than occasions.

		<h2>Poetry and Tanka</h2>

		<p>
		  I am not a poet by profession, but I do like to write a few lines
		  at times. Sometime back I have self-published
		  <a href="http://pothi.com/pothi/book/barun-saha-swapner-kheya">
			Swapner Kheya</a>, a collection of Bengali poems.
		</p>

		<p>
			Currently, I mostly write <a href="https://twitter.com/search?l=&q=%23tanka%20from%3A1barun&src=typd">tanka</a>, a Japanese form of short poetry that has gained huge popularity in English as well. In its English adaptation, a tanka is written in five lines with (at most) 31 syllables. While some (including myself) stick to the 5-7-5-7-7 syllable pattern, many use fewer than those.
		</p>

		<p>
			A takna, however, is much more than syllables. Out of the five lines, the first two typically talks about a particular <em>observation/event</em>, while the last two lines are the observer's <em>reflections</em>. The third line acts a <em>pivot</em> joining the other two parts of the poem. Therefore, the first three and the last three lines can typically stand out independently.
