		<h2>The DTN Blog</h2>

		<p>
		  When I started with my research back in 2011, I was quick to get familiar
		  with the Opportunistic Network Environment (ONE) simulator. However, I
		  soon realized the lack of substantial documentation and walthrough.
		  And thus, I began with the
		  <a href="http://delay-tolerant-networks.blogspot.com/">DTN blog</a>!
		</p>

		<p>
		  Although I started with Google Sites, later I switched to Blogger.
		  A blog was useful to quickly publish new contents. Moreover, comments
		  from the users also made me feel happy :)
		</p>

		<p>
		  As of now, the DTN blog has, among others, a three-part tutorial on
		  the ONE simulator covering various aspects &ndash; the basics,
		  parameterized simulations and confidence intervals. However, more than
		  having a blog, I feel that through this blog I have been able to give
		  back to the research community, which itself had helped me on different
		  queries on a more than occasions.

		<h2>Poetry Anyone?</h2>

		<p>
		  Can't say that I am a poet, but yes, I do like to write a few lines
		  at times. Sometime back I have self-published
		  <a href="http://pothi.com/pothi/book/barun-saha-swapner-kheya">
			Swapner Kheya</a>, a collection of Bengali poems. Perhaps, I could
			have another book in the future if I manage to write something good.
