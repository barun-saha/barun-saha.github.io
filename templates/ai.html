		<h2><a href="#hackathons" name="hackathons">Generative AI Hackathons</a></h2>

		<p>
			2023 has been the year of Generative AI, with several Large Language Models and Large Multimodal Models becoming available. I have had participated in a few hackathons to gain a first-hand experience of these novel technologies and build a small solution or two that can help make our lives better.
		</p>

        <p>A list of few such GenAI solutions developed in some of the hackathons is as follows:</p>

                            As scientists and engineers, we often draw a lot of diagrams depicting systems, for example, architecture, state machines, and flow diagrams. However, writing their descriptions can often be tedious, but without which system documentation remains incomplete. With Sys2Doc, one can <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/barunsaha/sys2doc">generate system documentation based on a given diagram of any system</a>. Sys2Doc is powered by <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/gemini-support-on-vertex-ai">Gemini Pro Vision</a>.

                            Building an RAG app is easy. However, optimizing its different settings, such as chunk size and context, is necessarily not. With RAG2Rich, one can identify the optimal parameters/configurations using answer "richness" score, which is evaluated based on the context relevance, answer relevance, and groundedness measures computed by TruLens. In other words, RAG2Rich offers <a href="https://rag2rich-vc4smj6o3q-uc.a.run.app/">a scientific approach toward optimizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation System</a>. RAG2Rich is powered by <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/generative-ai-applications-with-vertex-ai-palm-2-models-and-langchain">Vertex AI and PaLM 2</a>, among others.

                            We often spend a lot of time to create presentation slide decks. Although AI can help us with generating content, it requires several additional works, and often software permissions, to actually generate a slide deck based on such content. With SlideDeck AI, <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/barunsaha/slide-deck-ai">users and generative AI co-create a presentation slide deck</a> in a few steps using Mistral 7B Instruction tuned. Previously, it used Llama 2, and had <a href="https://www.clarifai.com/blog/llama-2-hackathon-with-clarifai-winners-announcement">won 3rd place in the Llama 2 Hackathon with Clarifai</a>.

                            Poetry is food for the soul. On the other hand, an image is worth a thousand words. With Poem2Pic, one blends poetry with art. Poem2Pic enables the <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/barunsaha/poem2pic">generation of an image based on a poem</a>. In particular, Flan-T5, a large language model (LLM), is used to generate a very short summary of an input poem. The summary is then fed to Stable Diffusion in order to generate an image. The final image is displayed to the user.
