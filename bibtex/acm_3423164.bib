abstract = {Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) constitute an emerging technology in the field
of health care that makes health monitoring possible from oneâ€™s home itself. WBANs
open many challenges by placing sensors on/inside human bodies for collecting various
health-related information. Unlike traditional Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), communication
in WBANs suffers from high channel fading and attenuation due to human body fat. Therefore,
relay-based communication with data forwarding techniques is used to handle link failures
and poor network connectivity. Accordingly, in this survey article, we present a comprehensive
study of relay-based communication mechanisms in WBANs. We begin with a brief look
at the multi-tiered architecture of WBANs, how direct communication works, and how
relay-based communication is different. Subsequently, we present a detailed review
of relay node selection approaches, which, in turn, also affects how a WBAN performs.
In this context, we also look at the unique quality of service (QoS) demands of WBANs
and how they can be assured.},
