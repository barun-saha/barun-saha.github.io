		<h2>Virtual Labs</h2>

		<p class="bigger">
		  I feel lucky that I got the chance to be involved with the Virtual
		  Labs project sponsored by Ministry of Human Resource Development,
		  Government of India. During my stay at Indian Institute of Technology
		  Kharagpur, I have developed the <a href="http://virtual-labs.ac.in/cse08/">
		  Software Engineering</a> and <a href="http://virtual-labs.ac.in/cse28/">
		  Advanced Network Technolgies</a> Virtual Labs. I have led a team of
		  four people working on different aspects of the projects. I have
		  donned various roles including designer, developer, content writer
		  and tester. I have worked both on the front end, as well as, the back
		  end.
		</p>

		<h3><a href="http://virtual-labs.ac.in/cse08/">Software Engineering Virtual Lab</a></h3>

		<p class="bigger">
		  The Software Engineering Virtual Lab covers
		  popular topics on the subject catering to the university
		  syllabi and provides a workspace to the students to have hands-on
		  practice. This lab teaches ER modeling, various UML diagrams, cyclomatic
		  complexity, test suite design and other topics. Various software
		  including Graphviz and PlantUML have been used at the back end. The
		  workspace has been designed in such a way so that the students can
		  understand the basic concepts and building blocks, rather than simply
		  drawing some diagrams.
		</p>

		<h4>Challenges</h4>

		<p class="bigger">
		  The development of this lab offered multiple challenges among which
		  the most notables are:
		</p>

		<ul>
		  <li>
			The concept of an experiment is vague in Software Engineering.
			Furthermore, since it's all about modeling, there is hardly any
			<em>the</em> correct answer, which makes evaluation difficult.
		  </li>
		  <li>
			The lab covers diverse topics and no single software is available
			to let work on all the experiments. As such, multiple software are
			used in the back end, and appropriate interfacing had to be done.
		  </li>
		</ul>


		<h3><a href="http://virtual-labs.ac.in/cse28/">Advanced Network Technologies Virtual Lab</a></h3>

		<p class="bigger">
		  The Advanced Network Technologies Virtual Lab deals with
		  advanced topics in computer networks. This lab helps the students
		  understand the basic concepts of each topic through remote network
		  simulations using two simulatos &ndash; NS-2 and NS-3.

		</p>

		<h4>Challenges</h4>

		<p class="bigger">
		  Compared to Software Engineering, this virtual lab was relatively
		  easier to develop in the sense that it uses same (similar) workspace
		  for all the experiments. However, the challenge was somewhere else:
		</p>

		<ul>
		  <li>
			Patching NS-2 with several independently developed modules required
			fixing every syntax error encountered and was very much time
			consuming.
		  </li>
		  <li>
			Executing remote simulations and presenting the result back to them.
		  </li>
		  <li>
			The most challenging part, perhaps, has been to develop a toolbar
			to let users do performance evaluations based on his/her simulation
			results.
		  </li>
		</ul>


		<h2><a href="https://github.com/barun-saha/django_mailman_search">
		  Django Mailman Search</a></h2>

		<p class="bigger">
		  <a href="http://www.list.org/">Mailman</a> is a popular email list
		  manager. This Django project aims at making the email archives
		  searchable through an easy-to-use web interface. Haystack is used for
		  searching with Whoosh as the backend. Two management commands are
		  provided to load data from the archives and clear them all from the
		  database. The project, however, assumes that you have access to the
		  archive files.
		</p>

		<h4>Challenges</h4>

		<p class="bigger">
		  <ul>
			<li>Loading data from the archive files into the Django models.</li>
			<li>This being my first experience with Haystack, took some time
			to grasp the settings and process.</li>
		  </ul>
		</p>
